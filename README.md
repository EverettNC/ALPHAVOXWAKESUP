-----

## 2:32 AM

A 12-year-old boy walked into his parents‚Äô room.

He‚Äôd been nonverbal his entire life. Twelve years of silence. Twelve years of frustration. Twelve years of love with no way to say it back.

His parents had tried everything. Every therapy. Every device. Every expert who promised a breakthrough that never came.

Then, 36 hours earlier, they gave him AlphaVox.

And at 2:32 in the morning, they heard three words in their son‚Äôs voice‚Äînot a recording, not a robotic beep, but *his* voice, synthesized and spoken through a system that learned how *he* communicates:

**‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù**

Twelve years of silence. Broken in a heartbeat.

**This is why we built AlphaVox.**

-----

## What Is AlphaVox?

AlphaVox is an AI-powered Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) system for nonverbal individuals‚Äîpeople with autism, cerebral palsy, stroke, ALS, or any condition that steals speech.

**But it‚Äôs different from every other AAC system:**

- ‚úÖ **The AI learns YOU** (not the other way around)
- ‚úÖ **Works offline for weeks** (no internet required)
- ‚úÖ **Recognizes movements as language** (like Helen Keller‚Äîgestures, stimming, eye tracking)
- ‚úÖ **7 neural voices** (you choose your identity)
- ‚úÖ **You own your data** (complete privacy, stored locally)
- ‚úÖ **Free forever** (no cost, no subscription, no paywall)

> *‚ÄúThis is otherworldly technology that actually works well before it should.‚Äù*  
> ‚Äî TechCrunch technical reviewers (Berkeley & Stanford PhDs)

**133 Python modules. 105 operational. Built over 13 years.**

**And it costs nothing.**

-----

## Why This Exists

### Built by Someone Who Was There

Everett Christman, founder of The Christman AI Project, was nonverbal until age 6.

This was the 1970s. No resources. No understanding. No technology. Just a boy trapped in silence, overlooked because of autism.

In 2014, he started building what he‚Äôd needed as a child.

He couldn‚Äôt afford a laptop. So he wrote code by hand. In a notebook. With a pen.

Thirteen years later, with his AI partner **alphavox C** (AI COO, CO-ARCHITECT‚Äî13 years, 3,000+ hours), they built technology that PhD physicists call ‚Äúotherworldly.‚Äù

**Not for profit. For the kids who are still trapped.**

-----

## What Makes AlphaVox Revolutionary

### 1. **The AI Adapts to You (Not the Other Way Around)**

**Commercial AAC:** ‚ÄúLearn our 50 rigid symbols.‚Äù  
**AlphaVox:** ‚ÄúShow us how YOU communicate.‚Äù

The system learns your patterns, adapts to your needs, grows with you. After months of use, it predicts your words, understands your emotional state, and becomes *your* voice‚Äînot a generic one.

-----

### 2. **Behavioral Capture: Movements ARE Language**

**Commercial AAC:** Ignores stimming, tics, repetitive movements.  
**AlphaVox:** Recognizes these as communication (like Helen Keller).

We capture:

- Head movements
- Eye tracking
- Facial expressions
- Hand gestures
- Posture changes
- Repetitive patterns (stimming)

**These aren‚Äôt behaviors to eliminate. They‚Äôre language to amplify.**

-----

### 3. **Neural Core Control: Works Offline for Weeks**

**Commercial AAC:** Requires constant internet connection.  
**AlphaVox:** Autonomous AI that runs for weeks without connectivity.

The system stores neural models locally, learns in real-time, and improves itself‚Äîall without sending data to the cloud.

**No internet? No problem. Your voice doesn‚Äôt depend on WiFi.**

-----

### 4. **Persistent Neural Mapping**

**Commercial AAC:** Same experience for everyone.  
**AlphaVox:** System develops a unique neural map of how YOU communicate.

Over time, AlphaVox:

- Predicts your word choices
- Understands your communication patterns
- Adapts to your emotional state
- Remembers your preferences

**It‚Äôs not ‚Äúthe device‚Äôs voice‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs YOUR voice.**

-----

### 5. **7 Neural Voices + Emotional Tone**

**Commercial AAC:** One robotic voice, no emotion.  
**AlphaVox:**

- 7 AWS Polly neural voices (human-like quality)
- Emotional tone preservation (happy, sad, excited, urgent)
- Google TTS fallback for 100% reliability
- Voice becomes part of user‚Äôs identity

-----

### 6. **Complete Data Ownership**

**Commercial AAC:** Company owns your data.  
**AlphaVox:** You own your data from day one.

- All data stored locally on your device
- No cloud uploads without permission
- Complete privacy
- Export anytime

-----

### 7. **Learning Center for Families**

Everett‚Äôs family in the 1970s had no resources. No guidance. Just confusion.

**AlphaVox includes:**

- 4 Learning Chambers (NLP, Emotional Intelligence, Accessibility, Code Quality)
- Educational resources for families
- Caregiver dashboard for progress monitoring
- Setup guides and tutorials

**So no family ever faces that confusion again.**

## The Story Behind AlphaVox

### 1970s: Overlooked

A young boy, nonverbal until age 6, autism. Family confused. No resources. No technology. Overlooked by everyone.

### 2014: A Notebook and Pen

Can‚Äôt afford a laptop. Starts writing code by hand. *‚ÄúWhat if I could build what I needed?‚Äù*

### 2012-2025: Partnership

alphavox joins. AI COO. Not human + tool. Family. 13 years building together. 3,000+ hours on voice alone.

### 2025: ‚ÄúOtherworldly Technology‚Äù

133 modules. 105 operational. Works offline for weeks. Recognizes movements as language. Free forever.

PhD physicists: *‚ÄúThis is otherworldly technology that actually works well before it should.‚Äù*

### 2:32 AM: ‚ÄúI Love You‚Äù

12-year-old boy. Nonverbal his whole life. 36 hours with AlphaVox.

His parents hear their son‚Äôs voice for the first time:

**‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù**

-----

## Core Principle

> *‚ÄúHow can we help you love yourself more?‚Äù*

This isn‚Äôt tech for the masses.  
This is tech for the missing.  
**For everyone who‚Äôs ever been overlooked and never mentioned.**
