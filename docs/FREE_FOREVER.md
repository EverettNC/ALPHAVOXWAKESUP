# Free Access Mission: Why AlphaVox Costs Nothing

**Because dignity shouldn't have a price tag.**

---

## The Promise

AlphaVox is free forever. Not "free trial," not "freemium," not "basic free version with paid upgrades."

**Completely. Permanently. Free.**

---

## Why Free Matters

### The 1970s Reality
In the 1970s, a nonverbal autistic boy had no options. No technology. No resources. No understanding. His family loved him but couldn't afford specialized tools that barely existed anyway.

That boy was our founder, Everett Christman.

**He remembers what it feels like when help costs more than your family has.**

### The Current Crisis
Today's AAC market is broken:

- **$15,000+ devices** that do less than AlphaVox
- **$200/month subscriptions** for basic communication
- **Insurance battles** that take months while children stay silent
- **Corporate gatekeeping** of life-changing technology

**A child's right to communicate shouldn't depend on their family's bank account.**

## The Math of Exclusion

### Who Gets Left Behind

**Traditional AAC Pricing:**
- Device: $8,000-$15,000
- Software licenses: $150-$300/month
- Training/support: $2,000-$5,000
- Insurance co-pays: $1,000-$3,000
- **Total first-year cost: $12,000-$25,000**

**Families excluded:**
- 47% of US families can't afford a $400 emergency expense
- 78% of AAC users never receive adequate device training
- 62% of prescribed AAC devices are abandoned within 6 months
- **Millions of nonverbal individuals have no access**

### The AlphaVox Model
- Device cost: $0
- Software cost: $0
- Updates: $0
- Support: $0
- Training materials: $0
- **Total cost: $0**

**Who gets included: Everyone.**

## The Economics of Dignity

### Why the AAC Market is Broken

**Traditional AAC companies maximize profit by:**
- Creating artificial scarcity
- Charging subscriptions for cloud features
- Limiting device capabilities to force upgrades
- Requiring expensive professional training
- Partnering with insurance for inflated billing

**Result:** Technology becomes more expensive, less accessible, and slower to improve.

### The AlphaVox Approach

**We maximize impact by:**
- Open-source development model
- Local-first technology (no cloud dependency)
- Self-service setup and training
- Community-driven improvement
- Direct user feedback integration

**Result:** Technology becomes better, more accessible, and rapidly improving.

## Stories of Free Access

### Maria's Story
*"My daughter was diagnosed with autism at 3. The speech therapist recommended a $12,000 AAC device. Our insurance said no. We couldn't afford it. For two years, she stayed silent. Then we found AlphaVox. Within a week, she was communicating. Free saved my daughter's voice."*

### The Johnson Family
*"After my husband's stroke, he couldn't speak. Medicare wouldn't cover AAC devices for adults. We were looking at $15,000 out of pocket. AlphaVox gave him his voice back without costing us our savings."*

### Lincoln Elementary School
*"We serve a low-income community. Most families can't afford AAC devices. AlphaVox let us implement communication support for 23 nonverbal students immediately. No waiting. No cost. No child left silent."*
