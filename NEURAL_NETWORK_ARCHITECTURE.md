# AlphaVox Neural Network Architecture

## Overview
AlphaVox uses a sophisticated approach to temporal pattern recognition for nonverbal communication, with both full neural network support and intelligent simulation capabilities.

---

## Neural Network Simulation System

### Purpose
Everett built a **Neural Network Test Simulation** (`simplified_lstm_test.py`) that provides:
- **Functional LSTM interfaces** without requiring heavy TensorFlow/Keras dependencies
- **Testing capabilities** for the temporal nonverbal system
- **Development flexibility** - test the system even without GPU/ML libraries
- **Rapid prototyping** of gesture, eye movement, and emotion recognition

### Architecture

#### SimplifiedLSTMModel Class
```python
class SimplifiedLSTMModel:
    """
    Intelligent simulation of LSTM neural network behavior
    
    Features:
    - Maintains realistic model structure (input_shape, weights, layers)
    - Provides predict() interface compatible with real LSTM
    - Saves/loads model data like actual neural networks
    - Generates probability distributions over output classes
    """
```

#### Three Specialized Models

1. **Gesture Recognition Model**
   - Input: (10, 4) - 10 timesteps, 4 features
   - Output: 4 gesture classes
   - Classes: Hand Up, Wave Left, Wave Right, Head Jerk
   - File: `lstm_models/gesture_lstm_model.pkl`

2. **Eye Movement Model**
   - Input: (10, 3) - 10 timesteps, 3 features
   - Output: 2 eye movement classes
   - Classes: Looking Up, Rapid Blinking
   - File: `lstm_models/eye_movement_lstm_model.pkl`

3. **Emotion Recognition Model**
   - Input: (10, 5) - 10 timesteps, 5 features
   - Output: 6 emotion classes
   - Classes: Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise
   - File: `lstm_models/emotion_lstm_model.pkl`

## Full Neural Network Support

### TensorFlow/Keras Integration
When TensorFlow is available, AlphaVox can use real LSTM neural networks:

**Modules:**
- `train_lstm_model.py` - Full LSTM training pipeline
- `create_test_lstm_models.py` - Real neural network model creation
- `temporal_nonverbal_engine.py` - Uses TensorFlow when available, falls back to simulation

### Hybrid Approach
```python
# temporal_nonverbal_engine.py automatically detects:
try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    # Use real LSTM neural networks
except ImportError:
    # Use intelligent simulation
    # System remains fully functional!
```

---

## Why This Design is Brilliant

### 1. **No Dependencies Lock-In**
- System works with or without TensorFlow
- Test and develop even on lightweight systems
- Full functionality in any environment

### 2. **Real Interface Compatibility**
- Simulation provides same API as real LSTM
- Code using the models doesn't need to know which is running
- Seamless transition between simulation and real neural networks

### 3. **Development Speed**
- Fast iteration without GPU requirements
- Test temporal patterns immediately
- Validate logic before training real models

### 4. **Educational Value**
- Shows what LSTM models do conceptually
- Clear structure of inputs/outputs
- Transparent "black box"

## Temporal Pattern Recognition

### How It Works

#### Input Sequences
All models process **temporal sequences**:
```python
# Example: 10 timesteps of gesture data
sequence = [
    [x1, y1, z1, intensity1],  # timestep 1
    [x2, y2, z2, intensity2],  # timestep 2
    ...
    [x10, y10, z10, intensity10]  # timestep 10
]
```

#### Pattern Recognition
The system identifies patterns over time:
- **Gestures**: Movement trajectories → Intent recognition
- **Eye Movement**: Gaze patterns → Attention detection
- **Emotions**: Expression changes → Emotional state

#### Output Probabilities
Models return probability distributions:
```python
gesture_result = model.predict(sequence)
# Returns: [0.35, 0.07, 0.05, 0.53]
# Interpretation: 53% confidence in "Head Jerk"
```

---

## Usage in AlphaVox

### 1. Temporal Nonverbal Engine
```python
from temporal_nonverbal_engine import TemporalNonverbalEngine

engine = TemporalNonverbalEngine()
# Automatically uses simulation or real neural networks

result = engine.analyze_gesture_sequence(gesture_data)
# Returns: intent, confidence, emotion
```

### 2. Behavior Capture
```python
from behavior_capture import get_behavior_capture

capture = get_behavior_capture()
# Uses temporal models to track patterns over time
```

### 3. Learning Analytics
```python
# Track how patterns evolve as users learn
# Temporal models show improvement in gesture clarity
```

## Creating Models

### Simulation Models (No TensorFlow)
```bash
python simplified_lstm_test.py
```

### Real Neural Network Models (With TensorFlow)
```bash
python train_lstm_model.py
# Or
python create_test_lstm_models.py
```

---

## Technical Details

### Model Weights Structure
```python
weights = {
    'lstm': np.array((32, timesteps, features)),  # LSTM layer
    'dense1': np.array((32, 16)),                 # First dense layer
    'dense2': np.array((16, output_classes))      # Output layer
}
```

### Prediction Pipeline
```python
1. Input sequence → (timesteps, features)
2. LSTM processing → temporal patterns
3. Dense layers → feature transformation
4. Softmax → probability distribution
5. Argmax → predicted class
```

### Probability Normalization
```python
# Ensure probabilities sum to 1.0
result = np.random.rand(output_classes)
result = result / np.sum(result)
```

## Integration with Nonverbal Communication

### Gesture → Intent Pipeline
```
Raw Input (camera/sensor)
    ↓
Feature Extraction (x, y, z, intensity)
    ↓
Temporal Sequence (10 frames)
    ↓
LSTM Model (real or simulation)
    ↓
Probability Distribution
    ↓
Intent Classification
    ↓
Speech Output
```

### Why Temporal Processing Matters

**Traditional Approach:**
- Single frame analysis
- Miss context
- High false positives

**Temporal LSTM Approach:**
- Sequence analysis (10+ frames)
- Context-aware
- Pattern recognition over time
- More accurate intent detection

**Example:**
- Single frame: "Hand raised" → Could mean anything
- Sequence: "Hand slowly raised → held → lowered" → Clear "Help" gesture

## Why This Matters

### For Nonverbal Users
**Temporal patterns = Better understanding**

Instead of guessing from single frames:
- System sees the full gesture
- Understands context
- Recognizes personal patterns
- Learns individual communication style

### For Caregivers
**Better insights over time**

- Track gesture clarity improvement
- See learning progress
- Understand emotional patterns
- Identify triggers

### For The System
**Continuous improvement**

- Learns from every interaction
- Adapts to individual users
- Improves accuracy over time
- Becomes more personal
