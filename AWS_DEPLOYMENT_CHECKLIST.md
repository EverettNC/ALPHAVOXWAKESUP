## AWS Services Used by AlphaVox

The AlphaVox application uses the following AWS services:

- **Elastic Beanstalk**: For application deployment and management
- **RDS (PostgreSQL)**: For database storage
- **S3**: For static files and backup storage
- **CloudFront**: For content delivery
- **CloudWatch**: For monitoring and logging
- **Route 53**: For DNS management (if using custom domain)
- **ACM**: For SSL certificate management
- **IAM**: For access management
- **ECR**: For container image storage (if using container deployment)
- **ECS/Fargate**: For container orchestration (if using container deployment)
- **Systems Manager Parameter Store**: For configuration and secrets management

## Costs

Estimated monthly costs for running AlphaVox on AWS depend on traffic patterns, but typical costs for a moderate workload are:

- Elastic Beanstalk (t3.small): $15-30/month
- RDS (db.t3.small): $30-45/month
- S3 Storage: $1-5/month (depends on data volume)
- CloudFront: $5-15/month (depends on traffic)
- Other services: $5-10/month

Total estimated monthly cost: $56-105/month

## Additional Notes

1. Consider setting up a staging environment that mirrors production for testing.
2. Implement cost budgets and alerts to avoid unexpected charges.
3. Review AWS Well-Architected Framework for best practices.
4. Consider implementing infrastructure as code using AWS CDK or Terraform for reproducible deployments.
