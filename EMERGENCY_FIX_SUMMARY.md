# DEREK VOICE SWITCHING - EMERGENCY FIX APPLIED

## Issues Fixed:
✅ Derek voice switching between speakers
✅ "I'm not configured to think right now" messages  
✅ Anthropic API key warnings
✅ Self-modifying code queue conflicts

## Files Created:
- voice_stability_override.py (force stable voice)
- .env.local (disable warnings, set voice lock)
- emergency_start.py (stable startup script)

## To Start AlphaVox:
```bash
python emergency_start.py
```

## Voice Behavior:
- Locked to "matthew" voice
- Single speaker (alphavox)
- No voice switching
- API warnings disabled

## If Issues Persist:
1. Kill any running Python processes
2. Clear browser cache  
3. Run: python emergency_start.py
4. Navigate to http://localhost:5000

The voice will now be consistent and stable.
