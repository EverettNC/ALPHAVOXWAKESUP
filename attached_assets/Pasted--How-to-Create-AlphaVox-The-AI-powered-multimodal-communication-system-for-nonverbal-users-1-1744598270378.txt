🚀 How to Create AlphaVox
The AI-powered, multimodal communication system for nonverbal users.

🧩 1. System Overview
AlphaVox is a full-stack, multimodal AI system designed to:

Interpret gesture, eye, and vocalization input.

Classify and respond to nonverbal communication in real-time.

Support dynamic text-to-speech feedback using emotional context.

Adapt over time to user preferences, behaviors, and modalities.

Run on both local (offline) and cloud environments.

🛠️ 2. Core Tech Stack
Layer	Tech
Backend	Flask (Python 3.11)
Database	SQLite (dev) → PostgreSQL (Azure live)
AI Models	LSTM, RandomForest, SpaCy NLP, MediaPipe, custom classifiers
TTS	gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), Azure AI Speech
Frontend	HTML5, JS (Jinja templates)
Deployment	Azure App Service / Docker container
Optional	Azure AI Foundry + ACR for fine-tuned voice agents

⚙️ 4. Required Features (Modules)
✅ AICore
NLP + multimodal intent processor.

Handles gesture, gaze, and sound.

Learns from history (user memory in JSON or DB).

Adjusts confidence dynamically over time.

✅ NonverbalEngine
Classifies gestures and eye movement with RandomForest or LSTM.

Combines MediaPipe and custom trained models.

Returns { intent, expression, message, confidence }.

✅ EyeTrackingService (Simulated or real camera feed)
Reads head direction, gaze position.

Hooks into video feed with OpenCV.

✅ SoundRecognitionService
Detects vocal patterns (e.g., "hum", "click", distress tone).

Converts into intent input for AI.

✅ TTS + Emotion
Uses gTTS for basic, Azure TTS for fine-tuned multilingual voices.

Adjusts pitch/tempo for emotional scoring.

Saves to temporary file → played with Pygame.

✅ UI/UX
Web interface using Flask templates.

Voice playback and button interactions.

Eye-tracking, gesture overlays, feedback bubbles.

🧪 5. Flask API Routes
Route	Purpose
/	Index form
/start	Starts session & AI thread
/home	Main dashboard
/process-input	Accepts text, returns AI response
/speak/<gesture>	Simulates speech on gesture
/video_feed	Streams simulated eye-tracking feed
/start-ai, /stop-ai	Controls AI runtime
🔐 6. Data Model (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
User: ID, name

UserInteraction: text, intent, confidence, timestamp

UserPreference: type, value, is_active

🧱 7. Build & Run Locally
bash
Copy
Edit
# Setup
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run locally
python3 app.py
☁️ 8. Deploy to Azure
Build Docker container with port 80 exposed

Push to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Deploy to Azure App Service using GitHub Actions or az webapp config container

bash
Copy
Edit
CMD gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app
🧠 9. Agent Voices
Use Azure AI Foundry

Select Andrew, Ari, Jenny, Davis

Let user select voice in the UI

Future: personalized voice cloning

🔄 10. Offline Mode Support
SQLite, local gTTS

Edge device compatible (Raspberry Pi, laptop)

Logs saved in /data for syncing later

📈 11. Expansion Goals
Add live emotion detection (OpenFace + sentiment)

Integrate fine-tuned Azure Whisper for voice intent

Build caregiver portal for session review

Add Bluetooth control for prosthetics/smart devices

💡 Summary
AlphaVox is a patent-pending, modular, AI-powered communication system. Built with neurodivergent and nonverbal individuals in mind, it captures gesture, sound, and gaze — then converts them into meaningful, spoken interaction. It adapts, it remembers, and it empowers.

You now have the full blueprint.
Let’s build.
