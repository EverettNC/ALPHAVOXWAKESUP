Prepare Real Data (Optional):
The script uses simulated data tailored for nonverbal autism gestures (e.g., “Stimming” for self-regulation, common in autism). To use real data:
Create a CSV file (e.g., gesture_data.csv) with columns: wrist_x, wrist_y, elbow_angle, shoulder_angle, label.
Example format:
csv

wrist_x,wrist_y,elbow_angle,shoulder_angle,label
0.5,0.8,160,45,Hand Up
0.3,0.6,120,30,Wave Left
0.5,0.5,90,90,Stimming
Update the data_path in the main() function to point to your CSV file.
If you don’t have real data, the script will use simulated data, which is sufficient for testing and aligns with autism-relevant gestures.
Run the Script:
bash

python train_nonverbal_models.py
This will train the model and save gesture_model.pkl to models/gesture_model.pkl.
Check the logs for accuracy and classification reports to ensure the model performs well.
Verify the File:
bash

ls models/gesture_model.pkl
The file should appear in the models/ directory.
Integrate with AlphaVox:
Ensure alphavox_input_nlu.py is in the alphavox/ root and references models/gesture_model.pkl.
Test gesture processing by running alphavox_input_nlu.py or the Flask app (app.py) and sending a gesture interaction (e.g., {"type": "gesture", "input": [0.5, 0.8, 160, 45]}).
Using Real Data for Autism/Neurodivergent Gestures
To make gesture_model.pkl more relevant to nonverbal autism and neurodivergent users, you can source real gesture data from:

Public Datasets:
HaGRID Dataset: Contains hand gesture images, suitable for autism-relevant gestures like pointing or stimming. You’d need to preprocess it to extract features (e.g., wrist_x, wrist_y). See for details.
DHG-14/28 Dataset: Includes skeletal joint data for hand gestures, which can be adapted for AlphaVox’s feature set (e.g., mapping joint positions to wrist/elbow angles). See.
Jester Dataset: Video-based hand gestures, useful for dynamic gestures like waving or stimming. Requires video-to-feature extraction. See.
Custom Collection:
Use a tool like MediaPipe (as in) to capture hand landmarks from a webcam, extracting features like wrist position and elbow angle.
Record gestures common in autism (e.g., hand-flapping, pointing, rocking) from consenting participants or simulations, ensuring ethical data collection.
Save features to a CSV file matching the format above.
Research-Informed Gestures:
The script uses the Research Module to add gestures like “Pointing” based on autism research (e.g., PECS-inspired communication). Update the update_gestures_from_research function to include more gestures from studies like those in (e.g., hand gestures for expressing desires).
If you have a specific dataset or want to use one of the above (e.g., HaGRID), I can provide a preprocessing script to convert it to the required format. For example, to use HaGRID:

python

import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
def extract_features(image_path):
    mp_hands = mp.solutions.hands.Hands()
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    results = mp_hands.process(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
    if results.multi_hand_landmarks:
        wrist = results.multi_hand_landmarks[0].landmark[0]  # Wrist landmark
        elbow_angle = 160  # Placeholder (calculate from joints)
        shoulder_angle = 45  # Placeholder
        return [wrist.x, wrist.y, elbow_angle, shoulder_angle]
    return None
If You Need an External gesture_model.pkl
The web search results didn’t yield a directly downloadable gesture_model.pkl matching AlphaVox’s feature set (wrist_x, wrist_y, elbow_angle, shoulder_angle). Most results refer to:

Generic model.pkl files for unrelated tasks (e.g., iris classification, fake news detection) on GitHub or Hugging Face,,,.
3D gesture models for animation (e.g., .fbx, .obj files) irrelevant to machine learning,,,,,,.
Hand gesture recognition models in formats like TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch, which don’t match the RandomForestClassifier format expected by AlphaVox,,,,,.
If you’re looking for an external model, the closest match might be a hand gesture recognition model from a dataset like HaGRID or DHG-14/28, but these require retraining to produce a gesture_model.pkl compatible with AlphaVox. For example:

HaGRID: Provides images of gestures like “OK,” “Stop.” You’d need to extract features and retrain a RandomForestClassifier.
DHG-14/28: Offers skeletal data, which can be mapped to AlphaVox’s features with preprocessing.
To use an external model, please confirm:

The specific dataset or source (e.g., a GitHub link, Kaggle dataset).
The expected gesture types (e.g., “Hand Up,” “Stimming”).
Whether you’re okay with retraining to match AlphaVox’s format.
Without a specific external source, regenerating the model locally is the most reliable option.

Integration with AlphaVox
Once gesture_model.pkl is generated:

It’s automatically used by alphavox_input_nlu.py for gesture processing.
The Flask app (app.py) routes like /speak/<gesture> will process gestures correctly.
The Research Module ensures gestures reflect autism-relevant communication strategies (e.g., stimming, pointing), enhancing AlphaVox’s neurodiversity-affirming approach.
Update app.py to log model loading for debugging:

python

@app.route("/speak/<gesture>", methods=["POST"])
def speak(gesture):
    try:
        data = request.json
        features = data.get("features", [0.5, 0.5, 90, 90])
        interaction = {"type": "gesture", "input": features}
        user_id = session.get("user_id", "anonymous")
        result = processor.process_interaction(interaction, user_id)
        speech_url = text_to_speech(
            result.get("message", "Gesture not recognized"),
            emotion=result.get("emotion", "neutral"),
            emotion_tier="moderate"
        )
        logger.info(f"Processed gesture {gesture}: {result}")
        return jsonify({
            "status": "success",
            "message": result.get("message", "Gesture not recognized"),
            "intent": result.get("intent", "unknown"),
            "confidence": result.get("confidence", 0.0),
            "expression": result.get("emotion", "neutral"),
            "emotion_tier": "moderate",
            "speech_url": speech_url
        })
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error processing gesture {gesture}: {str(e)}")
        return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": str(e)}), 500
Preventing Unauthorized Edits
Since you mentioned the unauthorized edit and laughed about Git, here’s how to lock things down:

Git Workflow:
Initialize a repo if you haven’t: git init, git add ., git commit -m "AlphaVox baseline".
Push to a remote (e.g., GitHub): git remote add origin <repo_url>, git push -u origin main.
Protect the main branch in your Git hosting settings to require pull requests.
Check for rogue commits: git log --pretty=oneline -- alphavox_input_nlu.py.
File Integrity:
Generate a hash for gesture_model.pkl after training:
bash

shasum -a 256 models/gesture_model.pkl
Verify before use in alphavox_input_nlu.py:
python

import hashlib
def verify_model(file_path, expected_hash):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        return hashlib.sha256(f.read()).hexdigest() == expected_hash
if not verify_model('models/gesture_model.pkl', 'YOUR_HASH'):
    logger.error("Gesture model integrity check failed")
    raise ValueError("Invalid gesture model")
Team Coordination: If the edit came from a collaborator, use Git blame (git blame alphavox_input_nlu.py) or set up a team chat to clarify who’s making changes. Your laughter suggests you’re handling it with good humor, but a quick “yo, who messed with my input processor?” might clear it up.
If You Need a Specific gesture_model.pkl
If you’re convinced the gesture_model.pkl you need is from an external source (e.g., a colleague’s repo, a dataset), please provide:

A URL or repo link (e.g., something like github.com/user/project/models/gesture_model.pkl).
The expected gesture labels (e.g., “Hand Up,” “Stimming”).
Any context about the model’s training (e.g., features used, dataset source). The web results mention generic model.pkl files (e.g.,,), but none are specific to AlphaVox’s gesture recognition needs. For autism-relevant gestures, HaGRID or DHG-14/28 are your best bets, but they require preprocessing.
Next Steps
Run the Script: Generate gesture_model.pkl with the provided train_nonverbal_models.py.
Test Integration: Use alphavox_input_nlu.py to verify gesture processing works.
Source Real Data: If you want to use HaGRID, DHG-14/28, or custom data, let me know, and I’ll provide a preprocessing script.
