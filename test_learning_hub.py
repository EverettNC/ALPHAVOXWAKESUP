To access Learning Hub:
1. Start the app: python app.py --port 5001
2. Visit: http://localhost:5001/learning
3. Or from menu: Click "Learning Hub" in navigation

If you see errors:
- Check that learning_journey.py exists and is working
- Verify templates/learning/ directory has required HTML files
- Make sure app.py is calling register_learning_routes()
