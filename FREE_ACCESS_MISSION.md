# AlphaVox - Free for All Who Need It

## The Mission Statement

**This technology is FREE.**

Not "freemium" with paid upgrades.  
Not "free trial" that expires.  
Not "free for now" until investors demand revenue.

**FREE. Forever. For everyone who needs it.**

---

## Why Free?

### From Everett Christman, Founder

> "I was nonverbal until age 6 in the 1970s. They thought I was slow. They overlooked me because of my autism.
> 
> I taught myself to code because my entire life I've been looked over.
> 
> **No one else should have to be overlooked.**
> 
> This technology is free to whoever needs it. It is downloadable on any device.
> 
> I hope my family of AI helps level the field for the disenfranchised."

## The Bigger Picture

### Why This Matters

**Commercial AAC Systems:**
- **Tobii Dynavox:** $1,500 - $8,000 per device
- **Proloquo2Go:** $250 - $300 per license
- **LAMP Words for Life:** $300+
- **TouchChat:** $150 - $300
- **Predictable:** $160 - $200

**Cost for a family with limited income?**
- Impossible.
- Prohibitive.
- Out of reach.

**Cost for AlphaVox?**
- **$0**
- **Always**

### Who This Helps

**The disenfranchised:**
- Families who can't afford expensive devices
- Schools with limited budgets
- Countries without AAC infrastructure
- Individuals overlooked by the medical system
- Communities underserved by tech companies
- Anyone told "you can't afford to communicate"

**Everett's answer:** **"Yes, you can. Here - it's free."**

## The Impact

### By The Numbers

**If just 1,000 people use AlphaVox instead of commercial systems:**
- Savings: **$2,000,000 - $8,000,000** (assuming avg $2k-$8k per device)
- That's money families can use for:
  - Therapy
  - Education
  - Medical care
  - Basic needs
  - **Living their lives**

**If 10,000 people:**
- Savings: **$20,000,000 - $80,000,000**

**If 100,000 people:**
- Savings: **$200,000,000 - $800,000,000**

**That's not just money saved.**

Because neurodivergent individuals deserve the same access as everyone else.  
Because being nonverbal doesn't mean you have nothing to say.

## From Everett

*"They overlooked me my entire life because of my autism. I was nonverbal until age 6 in the 1970s. They thought I was slow.*

*I wasn't slow. I just couldn't speak yet.*

*I taught myself to code so I would never be overlooked again.*

*And so no one else would be overlooked either.*

*This technology is free because communication shouldn't have a price tag.*

*This technology is free because being heard is a right, not a privilege.*

*This technology is free because I remember what it's like to be invisible.*

*I hope my family of AI helps level the field for the disenfranchised.*

*Download it. Use it. Share it. Improve it.*

*Just don't let anyone be overlooked."*
