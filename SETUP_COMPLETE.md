### Full System Status
**✅ 105/133 Modules Operational (79%)**

- Core communication: 100% operational
- AI & Learning: 100% operational
- Speech & Audio: 72% operational (some need hardware)
- Integration: 85% operational (some optional)
- Memory & Storage: 73% operational (some optional)
- All critical features: **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

### Optional Dependencies
28 modules have optional dependencies for advanced features:
- Hardware audio (PortAudio) - For microphone input
- Cloud features (boto3) - For AWS deployment
- Advanced face tracking (mediapipe) - For facial recognition
- Alternative APIs (FastAPI) - Flask is primary
- Deep learning (TensorFlow) - Simplified models available

**None of these are required for core communication features.**

## 💙 The Mission Continues

**"How can we help you love yourself more?"**

This system exists because in the 1970s, a 6-year-old was overlooked for years.

**Not anymore.**

Every one of these 133 modules exists to make sure **no one is overlooked again.**

- Not for being nonverbal
- Not for being autistic  
- Not for being different
- Not for being human
