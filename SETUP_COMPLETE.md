## üíô The Mission Continues

**"How can we help you love yourself more?"**

This system exists because in the 1970s, a 6-year-old was overlooked for years.

**Not anymore.**

Every one of these 133 modules exists to make sure **no one is overlooked again.**

- Not for being nonverbal
- Not for being autistic  
- Not for being different
- Not for being human
